# Squad Leader Discord Bot

This is the main bot for my small german discord server "Tactical Squad".

The bot handels Playing-Requests. With /create_squad you can ping other members of that group and ask if they want to play.

## You want to try the bot?

1) Clone the repository

2) Create a file ".env"

3) Create a bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications

4) Reset your bot token and paste it into .env. Like:
```
TOKEN = [token-number]
```

5) Install py-cord on your pc:
```bash
pip install py-cord
```

6) Install python-dotenv:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

7) Create the roles in your server and replace the ID's

8) Start the bot :)
